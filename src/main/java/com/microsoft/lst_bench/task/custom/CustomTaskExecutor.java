/**
 * Custom task executor implementation that allows users to execute dependent tasks. We call a
 * dependent task a task that iteratively executes a) a statement that is expected to return a
 * result; and b) a statement repeatedly that is expected to use that result. The result of the
 * first statement is stored in an intermediate object that can be specific to the connection. The
 * expected object for a JDBC connection is of type List<Map<String, Object>>, handling of other
 * objects would need to be added to the if-clause that checks the instance of the object.
