# LST-Bench: Configurations and Results
This folder contains configurations for running LST-Bench on various systems as depicted in the [LST-Bench dashboard](/metrics/app), along with details about the setups used to generate those results.

## Systems Included
- [x] Apache Spark 3.3.1
  - [x] Delta Lake 2.2.0
  - [x] Apache Hudi 0.12.2
  - [x] Apache Iceberg 1.1.0
- [x] Trino 420
  - [x] Delta Lake
  - [x] Apache Iceberg
- [x] Snowflake 8.13.1
  - [x] Native tables
  - [x] Apache Iceberg   

## Folder Structure
While the folder for each engine may have a slightly different structure, they generally contain the following:

- `scripts/`: 
  This directory contains SQL files used to execute LST-Bench workloads on the respective engine. 
  Typically, these SQL files may vary slightly across engines and LSTs based on the supported SQL dialect.
- `config/`: 
  This directory houses LST-Bench configuration files required to execute the workload. 
  It includes LST-Bench phase/session/task libraries that reference the aforementioned SQL scripts.
- Additional infrastructure and configuration automation folders, e.g., `azure-pipelines/`: 
  These folders contain scripts or files facilitating automation for running the benchmark on a specific infrastructure/engine.
  For instance, Azure Pipelines scripts to deploy an engine with different LSTs and executing LST-Bench. 
  Generally, these folders should include an additional README.md file offering further details.
- `results/`: 
  This folder stores the results of the LST-Bench runs as captured by LST-Bench telemetry using DuckDB.
  These results are processed and visualized in the [LST-Bench dashboard](/metrics/app).
