# LST-Bench

[![CI Status](https://github.com/microsoft/lst-bench/workflows/Java%20CI/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/microsoft/lst-bench/actions?query=branch%3Amain)

LST-Bench is a framework that allows users to run benchmarks specifically designed for evaluating the performance, efficiency, and stability of Log-Structured Tables (LSTs), also commonly referred to as table formats, such as [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/), [Apache Hudi](http://hudi.apache.org), and [Apache Iceberg](http://iceberg.apache.org).

## Usage Guide

### How to Build

#### Prerequisites

Install open-source Java Development Kit. As a recommendation, install OpenJDK distribution from [Adoptium]('https://adoptium.net/en-GB/').

#### Build

To build LST-Bench in Linux/macOS, run the following command:

```bash
./mvnw package
```

Or use the following command for Windows:

```bat
mvnw.cmd package
```

To build LST-Bench for a specific database, you can use the profile name (`-P`) option. 
This will include the corresponding JDBC driver in the `./target` directory. 
Currently, the following profiles are supported: `databricks-jdbc`, `snowflake-jdbc`, `spark-jdbc`, `spark-client`, `trino-jdbc` and `microsoft-fabric-jdbc`.
For example, to build LST-Bench for open-source Spark with JDBC drivers in Linux/macOS, you can run the following command:

```bash
./mvnw package -Pspark-jdbc
```

Or use the following command for Windows:

```bat
mvnw.cmd package -Pspark-jdbc
```

### How to Run

After building LST-Bench, if you are on Linux/macOS run `launcher.sh` or open a Powershell `launcher.ps1` if you are on Windows to display the usage options.

```bash
usage: ./launcher.sh -c <arg> -e <arg> -l <arg> -t <arg> -w <arg>
 -c,--connections-config <arg>   [required] Path to input file containing
                                 connections config details
 -e,--experiment-config <arg>    [required] Path to input file containing
                                 the experiment config details
 -l,--library <arg>              [required] Path to input file containing
                                 the library with templates
 -t,--input-log-config <arg>     [required] Path to input file containing
                                 the telemetry gathering config details
 -w,--workload <arg>             [required] Path to input file containing
                                 the workload definition
```

## Configuration Files
The configuration files used in LST-Bench are YAML files. 

You can find their schema, which describes the expected structure and properties, [here](src/main/resources/schemas).

NOTE: The spark schemas are configured for Spark 3.3 or earlier. In case you plan to use Spark 3.4, the setup and setup_data_maintenance tasks need to be
modified to handle [SPARK-44025](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44025). Columns in CSV tables need to defined as `STRING` instead of `VARCHAR` or `CHAR`.
Append the following regex replacement to the setup and setup_data_maintenance phases in the workload file:
```bash
    replace_regex:
      - pattern: '(?i)varchar\(.*\)|char\(.*\)'
        replacement: 'string'
```

Additionally, you can find sample configurations that can serve as guidelines for creating your configurations [here](src/main/resources/config).
The YAML file can also contain references to environment variable along with default values. The parser will handle the same appropriately. 
Example:
```bash
    parameter_name: ${ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE:-default_value}
```

## Architecture

The LST-Bench code is organized into two modules:

1. **Java Application.** This module is written entirely in Java and is responsible for executing SQL workloads against a system under test using JDBC.
   It reads input configuration files to determine the tasks, sessions, and phases to be executed.
   The Java application handles the execution of SQL statements and manages the interaction with the system under test.

2. **Python Processing Module.** The processing module is written in Python and serves as the post-execution analysis component.
   It consolidates experimental results obtained from the Java application and computes metrics to provide insights into LSTs and cloud data warehouses.
   The Python module performs data processing, analysis, and visualization to facilitate a deeper understanding of the experimental results.

### LST-Bench Concepts
In LST-Bench, we utilize specific concepts to define and organize SQL workloads, with a focus on maximizing flexibility and facilitating reusability across various workloads. For detailed information, refer to our [documentation](docs/workloads.md).

### Telemetry and Metrics Processor
LST-Bench captures execution telemetry during workload execution at multiple levels, including per experiment, phase, session, task, file, and statement.
Each telemetry event is recorded with an associated identifier, such as the statement's name or the phase IDs defined in the workload YAML.
The event includes information on whether it succeeded or not, along with any additional associated data.
Specifically, each event includes a _start time_, _end time_, _event ID_, _event type_, _status_, and optional _payload_.

The telemetry registry in LST-Bench is configurable, providing flexibility for different systems and use cases.
By default, LST-Bench includes an implementation for a JDBC-based registry and supports writing telemetry to DuckDB or Spark.
LST-Bench writes these telemetry events into a table within the specified systems, enabling any application to consume and gain insights from the results.

Alternatively, if the LST-Bench [Metrics Processor](metrics) is used, you can simply point it to the same database.
The processor will then analyze and visualize the results, providing a streamlined solution for result analysis and visualization.
